A Project With A Big Dream.

## Getting Started

In This project we are trying to copy [Medium](https://medium.com/), [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.com/), [Khan Academy](https://bn.khanacademy.org/), and create a Online Book Shop. 

Thus far i have implemented following features in the app:

    - Used flutter_login package for login/sign-in functions.
    - Used bloc methods to separate the business logic.
    - Used routing in the app.
    - Used streambuilder, and listviewbuilder in the app. 
    - Backend of the app is under development, so all the data is demo data.
